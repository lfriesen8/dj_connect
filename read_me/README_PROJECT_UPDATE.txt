*while major functions are working I'm in the process of giving the stylings of the page a rework as well as cleaning things up, 
ive tried to organize the project by frontend and backend functions. like previously mentioned there are things I still need to clean up and fix, but overall its coming together well and im on track to being finished by the due date.
